      "    ================\n",
      "    \n",
      "    There are more ways to train word vectors in Gensim than just Word2Vec.\n",

      "    \n",

      "    Usage examples\n",
      "    ==============\n",

      "    >>> model.save(\"word2vec.model\")\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The training is streamed, meaning `sentences` can be a generator, reading input data\n",
      "    from disk on-the-fly, without loading the entire corpus into RAM.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    It also means you can continue training the model later:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    >>> model = Word2Vec.load(\"word2vec.model\")\n",
      "    >>> model.train([[\"hello\", \"world\"]], total_examples=1, epochs=1)\n",

      "    >>> vector = wv['computer']  # numpy vector of a word\n",

      "    \n",
      "    It is impossible to continue training the vectors loaded from the C format because the hidden weights,\n",
      "    vocabulary frequencies and the binary tree are missing. To continue training, you'll need the\n",
      "    full :class:`~gensim.models.word2vec.Word2Vec` object state, as stored by :meth:`~gensim.models.word2vec.Word2Vec.save`,\n",
      "    not just the :class:`~gensim.models.keyedvectors.KeyedVectors`.\n",
